# Project Euler Haskell Solutions

### About
1. This repo contains my attempt at soltuions to the popular Project Euler questions.
2. It is being done as an exercise to get better at Haskell and FP in general.
3. As much as possible I am trying not to use external sources with the exception of the
Haskell docs + books, with some exceptions limited to short snippets.
4. I'm not looking at any full solutions to a problem before making my own first attempt.
